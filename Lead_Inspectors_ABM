;; how to differentiate between different types of turtles ?
  ;; want to make landlords, inspectors, tenants and judges
    ;; have different locations set, the agents move to that locatio
      ;; tenants move to doctors and then inspectors take action
      ;; landlords move to court, then take action
        ;; make the landlords act after court or make inspectors act
        ;; what agent acts is based on whether the LL cooperates or the
        ;; property has to go into receivership
;; create slider that shows how much money is available for remediation
